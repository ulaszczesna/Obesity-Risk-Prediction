## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Obesity Risk Prediction Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2/data)
- **Description:** The dataset consists of various health and lifestyle features that are used to predict obesity risk. The features include age, gender, dietary habits, physical activity levels, and other relevant factors.

## 📂 Directory Structure

### 1. 📁 Data
This directory contains the raw and processed data used in the project.

### 2. 🖼️ Images
This directory stores images used in the project, such as visualizations and plots generated during data analysis.

### 3. 🧠 Models
This directory includes the trained models developed during the project. Each model file contains the implementation details, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.

### 4. 📈 EDA.ipynb
This notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the dataset. The goal is to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and potential issues before proceeding to more complex analyses.

### 5. ⚙️ feature_engineering.ipynb
In this notebook, feature engineering is performed to create and transform features from the raw data. Feature engineering is crucial for improving the performance of the predictive models. In the FE process, we have replaced _weight_ and _height_ with _BMI_, since they were highly correlated.

### 6. 🧪 test_on_us.ipynb
This notebook includes testing the developed models on our personal features.

### 7. 📊 pairplot.png
This image contains a pairplot visualization used to analyze the relationships between different features in the dataset.
